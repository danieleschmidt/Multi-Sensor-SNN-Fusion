# ADR-001: Liquid State Machine Selection

**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Core Development Team  

## Context

The Multi-Sensor SNN-Fusion project requires a neural architecture capable of processing asynchronous, multi-modal sensory data with temporal dependencies. The system must handle:

- Binaural audio streams with varying temporal patterns
- Event camera data with sparse, asynchronous pixel events  
- IMU tactile data with continuous but irregularly sampled signals
- Real-time processing constraints (<10ms end-to-end latency)
- Deployment on neuromorphic hardware (Loihi 2, Akida, SpiNNaker)

Traditional RNNs and LSTMs, while capable of temporal processing, are not well-suited for:
- Asynchronous input processing
- Sparse computation patterns required for neuromorphic hardware
- Real-time operation with minimal latency
- Natural handling of variable-length temporal sequences

## Decision

We will use Liquid State Machines (LSMs) as the core neural processing architecture for temporal integration and multi-modal fusion.

## Rationale

### Technical Advantages

1. **Asynchronous Processing**: LSMs naturally handle asynchronous inputs without requiring frame-based synchronization, making them ideal for event-driven sensors.

2. **Temporal Dynamics**: The recurrent reservoir provides rich temporal dynamics and memory without explicit gating mechanisms, enabling natural temporal pattern recognition.

3. **Sparse Computation**: LSM computations are inherently sparse due to spiking dynamics, aligning perfectly with neuromorphic hardware architectures.

4. **Hardware Compatibility**: LSMs map efficiently to neuromorphic processors like Loihi 2 and Akida, enabling ultra-low power operation.

5. **Scalability**: Reservoir size can be scaled based on computational resources and task complexity without architectural changes.

### Performance Benefits

- **Low Latency**: No sequential processing requirements enable parallel computation
- **Memory Efficiency**: Temporal information is encoded in network dynamics rather than explicit memory cells
- **Robustness**: Reservoir computing provides natural noise tolerance and graceful degradation

### Research Foundation

LSMs have demonstrated effectiveness in:
- Speech recognition with temporal spike patterns
- Real-time sensor fusion applications  
- Neuromorphic computing implementations
- Multi-modal learning tasks

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Ultra-low latency**: Event-driven processing enables <1ms neural processing times
- **Power efficiency**: Sparse spiking computation reduces energy consumption by 1000x compared to traditional ANNs
- **Hardware optimization**: Direct mapping to neuromorphic chips without conversion overhead
- **Biological plausibility**: Architecture aligns with neuroscience research on cortical processing

### Negative Consequences

- **Limited expressivity**: Linear readout layers may constrain learning capacity for complex tasks
- **Parameter tuning**: Reservoir parameters (connectivity, spectral radius) require careful optimization
- **Training complexity**: Requires specialized learning algorithms (e.g., FORCE, STDP) rather than standard backpropagation
- **Debugging difficulty**: Internal reservoir dynamics are less interpretable than structured architectures

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Hierarchical LSMs**: Stack multiple LSM layers to increase expressivity
2. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple reservoirs with different parameters
3. **Hybrid Architectures**: Integrate LSMs with task-specific neural modules
4. **Automated Tuning**: Implement evolutionary or Bayesian optimization for reservoir parameters

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- **Pros**: Well-established training methods, good temporal modeling
- **Cons**: Sequential processing, poor neuromorphic hardware mapping, high latency

### 2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- **Pros**: Superior long-term memory, proven performance
- **Cons**: Complex gating mechanisms unsuitable for spiking networks, high computational overhead

### 3. Transformer Networks
- **Pros**: State-of-the-art performance, parallel processing
- **Cons**: Attention mechanisms don't map to neuromorphic hardware, high memory requirements

### 4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Pros**: Efficient spatial processing, well-understood architectures
- **Cons**: Limited temporal modeling capabilities, frame-based processing incompatible with event streams

### 5. Echo State Networks (ESNs)
- **Pros**: Similar to LSMs but with rate-based neurons
- **Cons**: Not suitable for spiking neuromorphic hardware, lacks biological realism

## Implementation Details

### LSM Configuration
```python
lsm_config = {
    'reservoir_size': 1000,
    'input_scaling': 0.5,
    'spectral_radius': 0.9,
    'connectivity': 0.1,
    'neuron_model': 'adaptive_lif',
    'tau_mem': 20.0,  # ms
    'tau_adapt': 100.0,  # ms

}
```

### Hardware Mapping Strategy
- **Loihi 2**: Map reservoir to neuromorphic cores with local learning
- **Akida**: Quantize reservoir weights and implement sparse connectivity
- **SpiNNaker**: Distribute reservoir across processing elements with real-time communication
